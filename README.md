# DeepExplainer_SHAP_LSTM
This is SHapley Additive exPlanations based on the integrated LSTM example, mainly for various types of mapping for DeepExplainer, some of the current mapping code is incomplete or only for TreeExplainer, this example provides various referenceable mapping. You need to run the LSTM model before you can run SHAP.
