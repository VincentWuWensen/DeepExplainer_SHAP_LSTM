# DeepExplainer_SHAP_LSTM
This is SHapley Additive exPlanations based on the integrated LSTM example, mainly for various types of plots for DeepExplainer. Some of the current teaching code is incomplete or only for TreeExplainer, this example provides various referenceable plots. You need to run the LSTM model before running SHAP.There are some useful reference:
